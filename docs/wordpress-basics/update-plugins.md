# Keeping WordPress Core & Plugins Up-to-Date

!!! danger
    **Keeping the WordPress Core, all plugins, & the Divi Parent theme up-to-date is essential to the security of the website.**

!!! note
 	I suggest signing up for the **[WordPress Vulnerability Database Email Newsletter](https://wpvulndb.com/subscribers/new)** to ensure you're promptly upgrading plugins, themes, or the WordPress core. **However, ensuring you're updated whenever you login to the WordPress Admin regardless is a good best practice to follow.**
