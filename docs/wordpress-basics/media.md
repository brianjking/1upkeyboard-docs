### Adding Media to the WordPress Library

* Login to **WordPress Admin area**.
* Navigate to **MEDIA** --> **Add New**
* Select the media you want to upload from your computer by clicking **Select Files** or **drag them from your computer to the selected area.**

!!! note
 	It is best to compress impress on your computer prior to uploading to WordPress. On Windows you can use [FileOptimizer](https://nikkhokkho.sourceforge.io/static.php?page=FileOptimizer) or on Mac & Linux I suggest using [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac).
