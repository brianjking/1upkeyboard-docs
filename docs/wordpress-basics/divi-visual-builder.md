!!! note
 	Divi has two ways of building unique, visually stunning, and easily customizable page and post layouts using the **Divi Builder**. The **Divi Builder** can be utilized when building out **Pages** and **Posts** throughout the website. You can utilize the editor while logged into the WordPress Admin area _**AND/OR**_ utiilize the **DIVI VISUAL BUILDER** to build/edit a page live in real time.
